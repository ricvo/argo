# argo

Argo is a library for deep learning algorithms based on TensorFlow and Sonnet. The library allows you to train different models (feed-forwards neural networks for regression and classification problems, autoencoders and variational autoencoders, Bayesian neural networks, Helmholtz machines, etc) by specifying their parameters as well as the network topologies in a configuration file. The models can then be trained in parallel in presence of multiple GPUs. The library is easy to expand for alternative models and training algorithms, as well as for different network topologies. 


## Installation

Requirements (stable):
* tensorflow-datasets      1.2.0    
* tensorflow-estimator     1.14.0   
* tensorflow-gpu           1.14.0   
* tensorflow-metadata      0.14.0   
* tensorflow-probability   0.7.0    
* sonnet 1.32
* torchfile
* seaborn     
* matplotlib
* numpy

Or:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run the code:
To run the examples provided in the framework (or new ones) one can choose between three separate modes of running:

1. single:
Runs a single instance of the configuration file
    ```bash
    python argo/runTraining.py configFile.conf single
    ```
1. pool:
Runs a muliple experiments (if defined) from the configuration file
    ```bash
    python argo/runTraining.py configFile.conf pool
    ```

## Submodules
#### VAE

```bash
python argo/runTraining.py examples/MNISTcontinuous.conf single
```
#### Helmholtz Machine

```bash
python argo/runTraining.py examples/ThreeByThree.conf single
```
#### Prediction

```bash
python argo/runTraining.py examples/GTSRB.conf single
```


How to run the code:
```bash
python3 argo/runTrainingVAE.py configFile.conf single/pool/stats
 ```
 
See ConfOptions.conf in examples/ for details regarding meaning of
parameters and logging options.
